# RandomSSNGenerator

## Uh, Hello. FBI?
* **NO!** Don't do that. This script creates **BOGUS**. How the script works is it creates a fake SSN using the **"random"** python module, and then proceeds to spit it into output. I created the script to try and see for myself how those weird websites work. *(Although, I think they pull the first three numbers from a list with special numbers, but just to stay safe from accidentally creating a real one, I'm just going to refrain from doing that and keep it simple and fun.
* **ANYWAYS...** if you're ever in a call with a scammer, just hit run and simply give them the **BOGUS** SSN that it generates. **YOU WILL NOT REGRET.** (Or, you may. Whatever. Just try it. Promise. It's fun.)
* **THAT IS ALL...**
* No, seriously. That is all. Run the script. What are you doing.
